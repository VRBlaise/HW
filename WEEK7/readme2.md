### Auto-incrementing

#### In the case when a unique number (a unique identifier or key value for example) needs to be defined at the addition of new entries to a database, this can be done choosing autto-increment for the corresponding column values when defining the database. This will automatically create a new unique value (usually starting from 1) for every and each new entry.

#### Subqueries standalone pieces of code that function independently and usually return a scalar value, which then can be used in the main quiry. Joins do not stand alone and return rows that are combined based on the match condition specified


```python

```
